🧠 How It Works

The program defines four functions:
add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide()

It asks the user to enter:

First number

Operator (+, -, *, /)

Second number


The calculation is performed and printed

The app continues running until you type n when asked:


Do you want to continue? (y/n)


---

📜 Example Usage

--- Simple Calculator ---
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50.0

Do you want to continue? (y/n): y


---

🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)

Add exponent, modulus, square root operations

Add input validation (non-numeric handling)

Add colorized output

Create menu-based UI

If you want, I can also generate a project folder structure, license, or help you create a GUI version of this calculator!
